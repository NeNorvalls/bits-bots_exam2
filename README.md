- The LandingPage component is declared functional and accepts a prop called setIsLoggedIn, likely used to update the login status in the parent component.
- It begins with a header section that contains a title ("Features").
- Below the header, there's a section for an ImageSlider component that likely displays images or content related to the application's features.
- There's a section with two columns for forms:
  - The left column contains a LoginForm component, and the setIsLoggedIn prop is passed to it for updating the login status.
  - The right column contains a RegisterForm component for user registration, but it doesn't receive any login status props.
